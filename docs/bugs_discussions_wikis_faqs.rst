Bug Reports or Feature Requests
-------------------------------

Got a bug/report to report or a feature request? You're in the right place.

Before submitting, make sure you have enough information to provide. It is advised to follow the provided template but feel free to use your own.
Just ensure you provide the following info:

* Your Operating system (Linux? Windows?)
* Your execution environment (Pycharm? VSC? A usual terminal? a cloud instance? a rasp pi?)
* Your python version and ``polygon`` version. always ensure you are on the latest version of the library. You can update if you're not using command ``pip install --upgrade polygon``
* The full stack traceback and error message if any. Do not attempt to describe error messages in your own languages. Sometimes messages don't mean what they say
* The code which causes the error. If your code is supposed to be secret, write a sample script which can reproduce the issue. Always make sure to remove sensitive info from logs/code

In case of feature requests, describe what functionality would you like to be added to the library.

.. _discussions_header:

Discussions
-----------

`Discussions <https://github.com/pssolanki111/polygon/discussions>`__ are meant to be a place for discussing general stuff which is not worth having an open issue for.

there are two discussion channels by default, `one meant for everyone <https://github.com/pssolanki111/polygon/discussions/1>`__ and `other meant for contributors/developers <https://github.com/pssolanki111/polygon/discussions/2>`__

while it is possible to create your own discussions, it is preferred to keep it to those two channels unless needed.

.. _wikis_header:

Community Wikis
---------------

`The community wiki <https://github.com/pssolanki111/polygon/wiki>`__ is a place for everything which the community finds useful for others but isn't in the documentation.
every article is just a title and the description text. written in good old markdown. You can write plain text too if you're unsure of what markdown is.

Figured out how to achieve a specific task? Found something interesting? share it with the community by creating a wiki page. Every contribution is significant so don't hesitate.

Read the wiki articles, you may find your answers there.

This is a handpicked collection of common questions and answers about the lib and endpoints in general.
A must read if you're looking for answers.

FAQs are added here as soon I have any solid conclusions about a useful question.

You don't necessarily need to know the answer :D
