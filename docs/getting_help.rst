Getting Help
============

I see you're stuck at something. don't worry, everyone does. Need a hand? Here is how you can get help.

* See if you can find the relevant info in :ref:`faq_header` or :ref:`wikis_header`
* See if there is an `Open Issue <https://github.com/pssolanki111/polygon/issues>`__ or a `Pull Request <https://github.com/pssolanki111/polygon/pulls>`__ related to your concern already.
* See if your issue has been discussed already in one of the :ref:`discussions_header`
* If you believe the issue could be on polygon.io end, get in touch with their support team. They're quite helpful. There is a button in bottom right corner of every documentation page

**Once you have gone through these and haven't found your answer, you can**

* Start a `Discussion <https://github.com/pssolanki111/polygon/discussions>`__. You can ask your questions in general channel or create a QnA discussion from left.

If your question is more of a bug report, you can raise a new `issue or feature request <https://github.com/pssolanki111/polygon/issues/new/choose>`__ with adequate information.

Remember that Issues is not a good place to ask for general help.

**Always make sure to provide enough information when asking for help. This includes**

* Your Operating system (Linux? Windows?)
* Your execution environment (Pycharm? VSC? A usual terminal? a cloud instance? a rasp pi?)
* Your python version and ``polygon`` version. always ensure you are on the latest version of the library. You can update if you're not using command ``pip install --upgrade polygon``
* The full stack traceback and error message if any. Do not attempt to describe error messages in your own languages. Sometimes messages don't mean what they say
* The code which causes the error. If your code is supposed to be secret, write a sample script which can reproduce the issue. Always make sure to remove sensitive info from logs/code
