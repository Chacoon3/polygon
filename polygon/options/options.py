class OptionsClient:
    """
    These docs are not meant for general users. These are library API references. The actual docs will be
    available on the index page when they are prepared.

    This class implements all the Options REST endpoints. Note that you should always import names from top level.
    eg: ``from polygon import OptionsClient`` or ``import polygon`` (which allows you to access all names easily)

    Creating the client is as simple as: ``client = OptionsClient('MY_API_KEY')``
    Once you have the client, you can call its methods to get data from the APIs. All methods have sane default
    values and almost everything can be customized.

    Any method starting with ``async_`` in its name is meant to be for async programming. All methods have their
    sync
    and async counterparts. Any async method must be awaited while non-async (or sync) methods should be called
    directly.

    Type Hinting tells you what data type a parameter is supposed to be. You should always use ``enums`` for most
    parameters to avoid supplying error prone values.

    It is also a very good idea to visit the `official documentation <https://polygon.io/docs/getting-started>`__. I
    highly recommend using the UI there to play with the endpoints a bit. Observe the
    data you receive as the actual data received through python lib is exactly the same as shown on their page when
    you click ``Run Query``.
